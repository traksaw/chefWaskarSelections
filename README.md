## Lessons Learned

Building this app provided an opportunity to:

1. **Utilize a REST API**: I learned how to interact with a RESTful API to fetch and display data dynamically in the browser.
2. **Implement Fetch APIs**: Understanding how to use `fetch` to make GET requests and handle asynchronous operations was a key takeaway.
3. **Style with Bootstrap**: I explored the use of Bootstrap to design responsive and visually appealing UI components efficiently.
4. **Integrate Custom Styling**: Balancing Bootstrap with custom CSS allowed me to enhance the app’s unique aesthetic.
